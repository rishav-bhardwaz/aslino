- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with scalability in mind, ensuring efficient handling of multiple simultaneous connections.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **WebRTC**: A technology that enables peer-to-peer audio, video, and data sharing between browser clients.
- **Socket.io**: A library for real-time web applications that enables bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment used to build the backend server.
